# Programming the Rib:bit

## Makecode - Blocks
## Makecode - Javascript

## Picking your Extensions
The Rib:bit includes a wide variety of functionality, and as such making every function available at once would create an enormous number of additional blocks, variables and functions in the Makecode editor. So instead we have split the functionality up into a number of sub-extensions that each deal with a select area of functionality.

The sub-extensions all automatically include the core `pxt-rib-bit` extension as all the common functionality is incorporated here.
